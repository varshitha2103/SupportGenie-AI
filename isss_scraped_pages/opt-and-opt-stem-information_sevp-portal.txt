Note: Students on OPT will not be able to access the ISSS Portal using their myUMBC credentials.When a student receives an OPT recommendation from our office, we send out an email with instructions on how to set up an ISSS Portal account using a personal email address.

Then, submit an “I-20 Reprint Request”.Remember to update your SEVP Portal record before submitting the I-20 Reprint Request.If you are having issues logging into your ISSS Portal account, please contact the ISSS office.
SEVP Portal Troubleshooting
Try these following methods if you cannot access your SEVP Portal account:
You forgot your password:  Go to theSEVP Portal login screen, click the “reset password” link, and follow the directions there.
Your SEVP Portal account is locked:Your account will lock after 90 days if you do not access it.  If this happens, first please try the “reset password” option from theSEVP Portal login screen.  If this does not work, please contact us, and we can request the account to be unlocked and you will receive an email with directions on how to access the account again.
Your password reset is not working:Please do NOT try to update your Portal on your phone – SEVP recommends using a computer for this step. They also recommend clearing your browsing history, and if you are using Google Chrome and are still unable to make the change, try Internet Explorer.
Your employer address is not accepted by the Portal:The Portal will make sure that every address entered for an employer is a legitimate address. Please enter addresses very carefully, and make sure to put the different parts of the address in the appropriate fields.  If you have entered the address perfectly and it is not accepted,please contact uswith the address and we can help with this.
Your name, birthday, or other personal details that you can see in the Portal are incorrect:Please contact us if you notice any errors to information in the Portal that you do not have access to. Please note that these pieces of information should match your I-20 exactly.
You do not receive an email to create your Portal account when your OPT starts:First, please note that you will only receive a Portal email on your OPT start date – not when it is approved, but when it actually begins!  The email will be sent to the email address in your immigration record, which is often changed to your personal email address when you apply for OPT to make sure you still receive these emails after you graduate and may stop regularly checking your UMBC email.If you do not receive this email in your personal email account, please contact us and we can make sure your email address is entered correctly in your immigration record.
You receive an email about the Portal from an email address other than UMBC ISSS staff or do-not-reply.sevp@ice.dhs.gov:This is likely a scam, please do not respond to any email not from us or the government email noted here!  SEVP is concerned that scammers may target students on OPT with fake emails about the Portal to try to get your personal information.  If you receive an email you aren’t sure about, please contact us and we can help determine if it is legitimate.
You asked ISSS to make a change in your immigration record today, but you don’t see the change in the Portal yet:There is a one-day delay in when information entered directly into the SEVIS immigration system is updated in the Portal. Try again after one day to verify the change.
