Economic Hardship Work Authorization
If you are an F-1 student experiencing severe and unexpected financial hardship while studying in the US, you may be able to obtain off-campus employment authorization fromUSCIS.This authorization allows you to work to meet some of your living expenses. Keep in mind that economic hardship employment will probably not sustain all your financial needs during your difficult time and you should not rely on this to solve your situation for the reminder of your stay at UMBC as a student.  Please note, Economic Hardship work authorization is extremely difficult to get approved, and the application should only be compiled for those in truly dire need.
Eligibility
To qualify for economic hardship employment, you meet the following conditions:
You must have been in F-1 status for at least one full academic year (two semesters)
You must be able to document the circumstances which led to your economic situation wereunforeseen,unexpectedandbeyond your control.
You must maintain your status by being enrolled in school full time during the spring and fall semesters when school is in session.
Conditions & Restrictions
Economic hardship employment authorization cards are issued in increments of one year at a time until your date of graduation (end date on I-20).
If you transfer from one school to another, the work authorization expiresimmediately.
Employment is limited to 20 hours a week when school is in session (spring and fall) and full time (more than 20 hours) during official school breaks (spring break, summer session, winter break and session).
You are still required to maintain full-time enrollment during the semesters
You can seek any job and the employment does not have to be related to your course of study.
Economic hardship does not affect your ability to be eligible for optional practical training (OPT).
Examples of unforeseen circumstances beyond your control include:
Death or severe illness of the financial sponsor
Loss of scholarship by no fault of the student
Substantial inflation of home currency rate
Natural disaster in home country that shows family has been directly affected
Unexpected and severe increase in tuition, fees or living expenses
Unforeseen and unexpected medical expenses of a family member, such as emergency surgery
Application Process
Meet with an international student advisor to discuss whether you are eligible to apply for this benefit. Please bring any and all documentation showing proof that your financial situation necessitates applying for the economic hardship. If we determine you to be eligible to apply for economic hardship, the advisor will request a new I-20 with a recommendation for economic hardship.
Please note, the application can take up to 3 months to process.
