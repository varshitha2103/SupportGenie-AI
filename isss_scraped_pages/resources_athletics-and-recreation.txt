The Club Sports Program at UMBC, funded and maintained by the Department of Athletics and under the direction of the Sport Club Council (SCC) and the Office of Rec Sports, is comprised of 25 club sports. Each club sport is a student-led organization that is formed, developed, governed, and administered by the student membership of that particular club, working with the Sport Clubs Coordinator.

Retrievers Athletic Center (RAC)
The RAC’s myUMBC Group
The Retriever Activities Center (RAC), a multi-million dollar addition to the existing UMBC Fieldhouse (Now the RAC Arena), was completed in the fall of 1999. The new addition added 52,700 square feet, nearly doubling the size of the previous UMBC Fieldhouse and included a new, 18,463 square foot multi-purpose gymnasium, a 3,257 square foot recreational weight room, an additional 2,526 square foot auxiliary gymnasium, a 2,191 square foot lobby, as well as fifteen additional offices for the Department of Athletics, and Physical Education and Recreation, two conference rooms, and new men’s and women’s staff and general locker rooms.
The multi-purpose RAC gym is composed of a urethane surface and is fitted with nine traditional basketball hoops and can be divided into three separate courts to be used for a variety of recreational and intramural sports and activities, including indoor tennis, lacrosse, soccer, flag football, etc. The gym is overlooked by a fitness, cardio balcony, which includes a variety of state-of-the-art treadmills, elliptical machines, and stationery bikes for a grand total of 50 cardio machines. While using this equipment, students, faculty and staff, and RAC members can gaze at one of the eight, overhanging plasma flat screen televisions.
Also located on the cardio balcony is the entrance to a secondary gymnasium, or fitness studio. The fitness studio is fitted with a hardwood, polyurethane floor, as well as a full wrestling mat, and can be used for a variety of uses including fitness classes, martial arts classes and clubs, ballroom dancing, and the club wrestling team.
The ground floor of the RAC houses additional cardio fitness equipment and a state-of-the-art weight room, in addition to men’s and women’s staff and men’s and women’s general locker rooms. The weight room is specifically for the recreation users and physical education classes and contains a multitude of free-standing weights and benches and Cybex weight machines.
Finally, the lobby at the entrance to the RAC was part of the 1999 addition and houses the front desk as well as the Retriever Pro Shop and the ticket office. Additions to the RAC that were completed in 2005 included a new student-athlete academic center and sports medicine facility, which are located to the right of the RAC lobby.
