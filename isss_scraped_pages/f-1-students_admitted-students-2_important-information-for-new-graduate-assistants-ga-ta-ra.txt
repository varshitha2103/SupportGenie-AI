Graduate Assistantships (TA, RA)
Assistantships are a great way for graduate students to help fund their studies, however, positions are competitive and funded by individual departments. If you are interested in an assistantship, please contact your department to find out what opportunities may be available. If you have been offered a Graduate Assistantship by your department, please carefully review the information below to learn more about what to expect upon your arrival to UMBC. Complete information about graduate assistantships can be foundhere.
PLANNING YOUR BUDGET AND EXPENSES
Initial costs upon arrival to UMBCBecause of the timing required to process payroll paperwork, Graduate Assistants do not usually receive their first paycheck until typically6 weeks, or possibly longer, after beginning the payroll process with their department.Please plan to cover your own expenses from the time you arrive in the US, throughat leastthe first 6 weeks that you are in the US, as you wait to begin receiving your paychecks.Please contact your academic department for more details about the payroll process.

Your bi-weekly stipend, and taxesYour assistantship award letter will usually indicate the total amount you are awarded per year, as well as how much you will receive in each paycheck.  Paychecks are issued every 2 weeks.Please note,the amount of your stipend DOES NOT account for the taxesthat will be taken out.The amount of taxes that are taken out of your paycheck is determined by many factors. You can work with your payroll provider in your academic department to try to get a more specific idea of how much you will receive each paycheck, after the tax amount is removed.  Sometimes as much as 30% of your paycheck will be taken out for taxes, so please plan accordingly!

APPLYING FOR A SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER (SSN)
An SSN is required of any individual in order to get paid in the US.
You can only apply for an SSN after the following:You are physically in the US in F-1 immigration statusYour SEVIS (immigration) record has been activated by ISSS
You are physically in the US in F-1 immigration status
Your SEVIS (immigration) record has been activated by ISSS
Please note, you cannot begin the process of getting on payroll with your department until you have applied for a social security number.
The delay in applying for an SSN is often an important reason as to why students cannot get paid earlier in their first semester.  Students with existing SSN’s may not experience such a drastic delay in their first paycheck.
The ISSS team will help you with the SSN application process. Please clickhereto learn more.
OF SPECIAL NOTE TO STUDENTS CHANGING THEIR IMMIGRATION STATUS:
Please note that you cannot hold a GA position unless you are in an immigration status that allows you to work and be paid in the US.
Please contact ISSS with questions about whether or not your status allows you to work.  There are different ways to change your status based on your situation and how much time you have.  Please plan ahead, and contact us early!
RESOURCES FOR MORE INFORMATION
All GA’s are expected to have read and understood theGraduate Assistant Handbook.  Please be sure to address all questions with your GA supervisor.
The Payroll staff person in the academic department in which you have your assistantship will also be responsible for helping you with payroll forms and can help with many questions you may have about your payment for your GA.
ISSS can help you apply for your SSN once you have met the requirements to do so.
