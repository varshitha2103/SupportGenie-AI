CPT: Off-Campus Work Authorization
Curricular Practical Training (CPT) allows F-1 international students to work off-campus in paid positions within the US. CPT requires an application completed by the student, which can be submitted via the ISSS Portal.  Once approved, ISSS will add CPT work authorization to the student’s immigration record, and issue a new Form I-20 noting the work authorization.

After CPT Is Approved
Students receive an email from our office when their CPT is approved. Follow the directions in the email to log into the ISSS Portal and download the I-20 with CPT approval. Students should check if all information on their I-20 is correct. If there are any mistakes, let our office know.
Students also need a Social Security Number (SSN) to begin working. SSN are issued by the United States Social Security Administration (SSA). To start the process, students should submit a SSN letter request in the ISSS Portal. More information on how to obtain a SSN is outlinedhere.
After a student has an I-20 with CPT approval and a receipt from the SSA, they present these documents to their employer’s Human Resources department. Students should discuss with their employer on any potential delays ahead of time.

Common scams are: receiving a job offer without applying, being offered the job without an interview, or sending someone money to accept the job.
Check the sender’s email address and see if it matches the domain of the company. A simple Google search will also show if the company and contacts are legitimate. Reach out to theCareer Centerabout any concerns.
FAQ
Generally, no. Students need to complete two academic semesters before becoming eligible for CPT. However, transfer students and students who completed two academic semesters in a different immigration status may be eligible.Contact usif you’re unsure.
There is no deadline for CPT. However, enrollment in an internship credit course is required. If you are enrolling in PRAC, check with theCareer Centerabout deadlines and requirements. If you are enrolling in academic credit, you can checkUMBC’s Academic Calendarfor class enrollment deadlines.
For part time CPT, there is no limit to the number of times you are approved. However, full time CPT is limited to amax of 12 months. After 12 months, students are ineligible for OPT.
If you are a PhD student, discuss your CPT and OPT plans with an ISSS advisor.
Your offer letter should state your position, start and end date of your employment, your roles and responsibilities, whether the position is part time (less than 20 hrs/week) or full time (more than 20 hrs/week), and your employer’s name and address.
Can I work full time CPT over summer?
Yes! You can work full time (more than 20 hrs/week) during the summer and winter breaks. However, you can only work part time (up to 20 hrs/week) during the fall and spring semesters.
Yes! You can work both an on-campus job and CPT. In the fall and spring semesters, you can work up to 20 hrs/week in an on-campus job and do part time CPT. This means you can work 20 hrs/week on-campus and 20 hrs/week on CPT. In the summer and winter breaks, you are eligible for full time employment in both positions.
I’m in my final semester. Can I do full time CPT?
Yes, but only if you are enrolled in 4 credits or less. Additionally, one of these classes must be an in-person or hybrid course.
Complete and submit another CPT request for the new position. If you enrolled in PRAC, let theCareer Centerknow of your change in plans.

Paid work in the US is almost always taxed. Your employer will work with you to complete the required HR paperwork, such as the Form I-9. More resources on taxes can be foundhere.
