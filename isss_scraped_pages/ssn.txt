Helpful Links and Information
Overview
You are required by law to have a Social Security Number (SSN) in order to be paid for work in the US.  If you are not working in a paid position, you do not need an SSN.  Unfortunately, SSNs are often used as identification numbers for other kinds of applications, such as credit cards or cell phone accounts.  While having an SSN is convenient, you can NOT apply for an SSN unless you have a job offer.
Eligibility
To be eligible to apply for a Social Security Number (SSN), you must have a valid offer for paid work.The Social Security Administration (SSA) will not issue a SSN to any F-1 student who has not already been given an offer of paid employment.
Are you eligible to apply for an SSN?
Do you have a valid offer for a paid position?
Has your SEVIS record been registered (activated) by the ISSS staff?If you are trying to apply before your I-20 Program Start Date, pleasecontact ISSSto make sure your record is registered
If you are trying to apply before your I-20 Program Start Date, pleasecontact ISSSto make sure your record is registered
Have you been in the U.S. for at least a few days?
Is your start date in the next 30 days?
If you are working off-campus, has your CPT been approved?
If you answered yes to ALL these questions, you are ready to go to the Social Security Administration (SSA) to apply for your Social Security Number (SSN).  You need to visit an office of the SSA in person – you cannot apply by mail or online.
Application Process
Receive your job offer letter.
Request an SSN letterfrom ISSS.
Locate the appropriate SSA office based on your U.S. address (ZIP Code) using theSocial Security Office Locator.
Make an appointment at the SSA branch office closest to you by calling the phone number listed.
Review the SSA’s guide “International Students and Social Security Numbers“
Gather therequired documents.
Be aware of scams!
SSA phone lines have been known to be intercepted and redirect you to a scam call center.
If you are offered a gift card or asked for payment information, this is a scam!  Hang up and try the number again
Required Documents
Before you visit the SSA office for your appointment, you need to gather the following documents.  All documents must be printed on plain, white paper, in standard US size: 8½ x 11 inches.
Your ACTUAL passport (not a copy)

After You Apply
You will recieve a receipt from SSA. You should present a copy of the receipt from SSA to your employer.
It can take two to three weeks to receive your Social Security card in the mail.
When you receive the card, it is important to check the spelling of your name, sign the card and take to the department where you were hired to complete any necessary paperwork.
Your SSN does not expire or change once it has been issued to you.
Letter of Ineligibility
This is a letter provided by the Social Security Administration to state that you are not currently eligible for an SSN. This is most commonly needed for the MVA, when you apply for either a State ID or a Driver’s License.
To apply, take the following to an SSA office:
Valid Passport
F-1 visa
Most recent Form I-20
Most recentI-94 record
You will also need a letter from ISSS office certifying your good F-1 status – please visit theISSS Portalto request this letter, and please allow a few days processing time.
