On-Campus assistance:Because taxes are not a University-related responsibility, unfortunately there are not tax experts on campus that can give tax advice.  The ISSS office can try to help with extremely basic questions, but please keep in mind that taxes are a completely separate professional field that we are not trained in and we cannot legally give tax advice without proper training!
In the Community:There are many tax prep companies, such as H&R Block, that you will see in your community.  Please be very careful in going to a place like this, as many tax professionals there are only trained on Resident taxes and won’t have the expertise to correctly help you with your NRA tax return.
