Inviting Family and Friends
If you would like to invite your family or friends to visit you in the US for vacation, for graduation, or any other reason, your visitors will likely need a B-2 visitor visa.
Letters for your visitors’ visa appointments
As a student inviting someone to visit, YOU should provide aletter of invitationto your visitors.  The U.S. Department of State indicates that an invitation letter from the university does not factor into the visa application outcome and is not helpful.  Because of this, UMBC does not provide letters of invitation.
Students can request a letter of student status or aletter of graduationfrom the UMBC Registrar’s Office to prove that you are graduating from your program. Additionally, you can order an official transcripthere.
Please read theU.S. Department of State’s websiteto learn more about the B-2 visitor visa.  For specific instructions, please visit your local Embassy’s website.
Who needs a B-2 Visitor Visa to visit the US?
Does your visitor already have some kind of American visa?  If not, is their only purpose in the US to visit you?  (Visitors with other goals may need a different visa type, such as for studying or short-term work).  TheB-2 visais the visa type for a visitor for pleasure or medical attention.
If B-2 is the appropriate category for your visitor, is your visitor eligible for a Visa Waiver?  You can find a list of requirements and participating countrieshere.
If your visitor is NOT eligible for a visa waiver, please review the detailed information on applying for a visitor visa below.
Applying for a B-2 Visitor Visa
Overview:
If your visitor will need a B-2 visa, thevisitor is responsible for proving that they do NOT intend to stay in the US!This intention is determined by consular officer at the time of your visitor’s visa appointment.  As with any visa appointment, the consular officer will be trying to answer the questions:
Who are you?
What do you want to do in the US?
Do you have the funds to cover what you are asking to do?
What are your plans after you complete your “approved activity” (in this case, a visit)?
The visitor must prove the following during the visa appointment:
The purpose of their trip is to enter the US for pleasure or medical treatment;
That they plan to remain for a specific, limited period;
Evidence of funds to cover expenses in the US;
Evidence of compelling social and economic ties abroad (at home, outside of the US); and
That they have a residence outside the US as well as other binding ties that will insure their return abroad at the end of the visit.
Specific Steps to Apply:
Plan ahead!  It can sometimes takes a long time to get a visa interview.  Look up average waiting times at different US Embassieshere.
Gather the commonly required documents to apply (see below)
Complete the online visa application (DS-160) and make a visa appointment for the interview.  These steps will have specific directions on the website of the Embassy where your visitor will apply.  The complete list of US Embassies can be foundhere.
Children 13 or younger do not usually need to apply, but check the Embassy website to make sure.
Fingerprints are often taken during the interview
Commonly Required Documents:
DS-160 visa application form, completed online, and visa fee receipt (paid online, often at time of application though this varies by Embassy)Valid passportPassport photos (for details on specifications, please clickhere).  Some Embassies will require these to be uploaded in advance of the appointment, and some will take their own photos as part of the appointment.“Evidence which shows the purpose of the trip, intent to depart the United States, and arrangements made to cover the costs of the trip. It is impossible to specify the exact form the documentation should take since applicants’ circumstances vary greatly.” (examples – proof of ties to your home country such as property deeds, proof of employment, original bank statements; travel itineraries)“Those applicants who do not have sufficient funds to support themselves while in the U.S. must present convincing evidence that an interested person will provide support.” (Provide a letter and bank statement)Letter of Invitation from Student– include, as much as possible, the following in your letter:Why you are inviting them to visit (for example, graduation, summer vacation, celebrate an occasion with you, like a birthday, etc.)Dates (or approximate dates) of visitWhere the visitor will be staying (for example, with you, in a nearby hotel, with other family in the US, with friends, etc.)How the visitor’s expenses will be covered (for example, by you, on their own, etc)“Depending on individual circumstances, applicants may provide other documentation substantiating the trip’s purpose and specifying the nature of binding obligations, such as family ties or employment, which would compel their return abroad.” (for example, the deed to a property, car, business or other major purchase; letter from employer proving employment and how long they have been employed there, etc.)Check specific US Embassy website for any additional requirements!You can edit the template below to write your letter.
