Creating a myUMBC Account, Registration and Billing
Students must create an online myUMBC account in order to register for classes and pay bills. Exchange students can create their online accountusing this link. Please remember that when you enter your date of birth to use the U.S. format (MM/DD/YYYY).
At the time of admission a UMBC Gmail account is created. You must activate it and check it regularly. Once you are admitted, all official university communications will be sent to your UMBC Gmail account.
All exchange students should begin the process of registering for classes online now through the myUMBC system. To register for classes, go to the “Guide” bar after you log into your account on myUMBC. Then go to “Classes and Grades,” and then “Student Schedule and Registration”. You can look up the online course catalog from the same website. You may need permission from the instructor of a class to enroll in the class. The Education Abroad Office will assist you in this process.
The UMBC Registrar’s Office has a guide onhow to register for classes.
Students log in to myUMBC and select the “Billing & Personal Finances” under the “Topics” tab. From there, they can select to pay their charges,view their e-bills, and enroll in the Monthly Payment Plan. Your online payment will post to your account immediately. Students will see their true balances anytime they review theirAccount Inquiry.
Information about paying your bill is available from UMBC’s Student Business Services (SBS) officehere. Please bear in mind that payments submitted late will accruelate fees.
As exchange students at UMBC, you will not be responsible for paying either tuition or standard student fees during your time here. However, if you enroll in a specific class that has a separate lab or participation fee, you will be responsible for that fee.
