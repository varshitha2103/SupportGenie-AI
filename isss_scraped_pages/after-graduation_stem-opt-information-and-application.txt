STEM OPT Extension
Students who have graduated from UMBC with a DHS-designated STEM degree can extend their initial year of OPT (Optional Practical Training) via the STEM OPT Extension. This type of work authorization is available to F-1 international students who have completed their program requirements and have already been approved for an initial period of regular OPT. STEM OPT Extensions are approved by U.S. Citizen and Immigration Services (USCIS), but also require support from the university ISSS office. Once approved for STEM OPT, students can work an additional 24 months in paid positions after their year of regular OPT.

STEM OPT follows federal and school regulations:
All work done pursuant to STEM OPT must be directly related to the student’s major program of study.
Students must first request and receive a special STEM OPT I-20 from the ISSS office before submitting their application to USCIS.
STEM OPT is granted only once per degree level.STEM OPT can only be authorized twice during your entire academic career in the US.
STEM OPT can only be authorized twice during your entire academic career in the US.
STEM OPT can only be approved as anextensionof regular OPT, meaning it must follow a period of approved post-completion (regular) OPT.
Once approved by USCIS:Students are approved for an additional 24 months of work authorization.Students must work inpaidpositions at least 20 hours/week witheachemployer.Employers must be enrolled and participating in theE-Verifyprogram.
Students are approved for an additional 24 months of work authorization.
Students must work inpaidpositions at least 20 hours/week witheachemployer.Employers must be enrolled and participating in theE-Verifyprogram.
Employers must be enrolled and participating in theE-Verifyprogram.
Applications for STEM OPT can only be submitted during the final 90 days of regular post-completion OPT. Students should plan ahead and begin the application process with the ISSS office as early as possible.
Eligibility
To be eligible for STEM OPT, students must meet following criteria:
Currently in active F-1 status
Currently participating in one year of regular OPT
Completed all program requirements for aSTEM-eligible degree
Pursuing work with an employer enrolled and participating in theE-Verifyprogram
Have not been previously granted OPT/STEM OPT at the current level of study
Application Process
The application process for STEM OPT is very similar to applying for regular OPT.Students must first receive a STEM OPT I-20 from the ISSS office before submitting their STEM OPT application to USCIS.After receiving the STEM OPT I-20, students must complete and submit an online application to USCIS. Applications submitted to USCIS without an STEM OPT-specific I-20 will be denied. USCIS processing times can take up to three months or more, so students should plan ahead and apply early.Contact our officeabout any concerns or questions.
STEM OPT applications must be submitted to USCIS no earlier than 90 days before your OPT end date and no later than your OPT end date. STEM OPT applications submitted to USCIS outside of this date range will be denied. Work with the ISSS office to prepare your application early.
Step 1: Request a STEM OPT I-20 from ISSS
Students must first request a special STEM OPT I-20 from the ISSS office.Applications submitted to USCIS without an STEM OPT I-20 will be denied.
Students must submit a completeSTEM OPT requestin the ISSS Portal. Students must upload a completed, signed Form I-983 Training Plan, draft snapshot of their Form I-765 (application), and a copy of theirofficial transcriptor diploma.
STEM OPT Administration Fee
Due to the additional administrative and reporting requirements imposed by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) during the STEM OPT extension, UMBC will now assess aone-time STEM OPT Administration Fee.
This fee will support services related to ongoing DHS reporting requirements and maintenance of status throughout the full duration of STEM OPT. Extended services provided to alumni pursuing STEM OPT include:
review and processing of mandatory reports, including Form I-983 Training Plans;
processing semi-annual STEM OPT validation reports;
Form I-20 travel endorsements; and
continued access to ISSS advisors for questions pertaining to your F-1 status and STEM OPT employment matters.
This one-time and non-refundable fee is charged at the time of submission of a STEM OPT Extension request in the ISSS Portal.
The STEM OPT Administration Fee is paid to ISSS to support STEM OPT participants throughout their time on STEM OPT.It is separate from the filing fee paid to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) when submitting a STEM OPT application on the USCIS application website.
ISSS will review each student’s STEM OPT request and send an email if anything is missing. Once approved, students will receive a Form I-20 with the STEM OPT recommendation listed on the second page.The I-20 should list “STEM OPT Requested” on the second page, with requested start and end dates. Please contact us if anything needs to be corrected.
ISSS will begin reviewing your STEM OPT request 90 days before your OPT end date. If you submit the request more than 90 days in advance, we will not process it until the window opens.

Step 2: Submit Form I-765 Application to USCIS
The ISSS office will review each STEM OPT request and email the student about any potential edits students should make on their draft Form I-765. Students will also be able to view their STEM OPT I-20 in their request.Students must print out and sign their STEM OPT I-20 with blue ink.Submitting an application without a signature will result in a denial. Finally, students must upload all required documentation and submit their I-765 application using theUSCIS online application system.The current fee for submitting an I-765 is $470.
I-765 Filing Tips
Part 1, line 1c: Select “Renewal of my permission to accept employment”
Part 2, line 8: Enter the A number (also called the USCIS number). This is listed on your current EAD card.
Part 2, line 17: Enter “C3C” for the eligibility category. This is the code for STEM OPT Extension.
Part 2, line 28a: Enter the degree name listed on your official transcript or diploma. If the name does not fit, you can use “MS” for Master of Science and “MPS” for Master of Professional Studies.
Part 2, line 28b: Enter the name for your employer. This should match the name listed in e-verify.
Part 2, line 28c: Enter the e-verify number for the employer. The e-verify number is a string of 4-7 numeric characters and is different than the EIN number.
Upload additional documents, such as: ID/Passport, I-94 record, EAD card, proof of degree (official transcript or diploma), etc.
BEFORE YOU SUBMIT:Double check to see if “STEM OPT Requested” with the requested start and end dates is on the second page of your I-20!If you submit your STEM OPT application to USCIS without this STEM OPT request listed, it will be automatically denied!
Step 3: Track Case Status
After submitting an application to USCIS, students will receive an I-797 Receipt Notice with a case number. Students can track the status of their application by entering their case number on theUSCIS Case Status website. USCIS processing times vary, and it can take up to three months to receive a response on an application. Checkcurrent USCIS processing timesfor an I-765 application.
If you recently moved or your mailing address has changed, update your address in your online USCIS account. It is important to list a current mailing address. Your EAD card will arrive at the mailing address listed in your USCIS online account. See further instructionshere.
USCIS recently expanded itsmyProgressprogram to include Forms I-765.myProgressaims to provide personalized processing time information, but it is a very, very new tool.
Form: I-765 | Application for Employment Authorization
Form Category: Based on a request by a qualified F-1 academic student [(c)(3)]
Field Office or Service Center: Potomac Service Center
Step 4: Review Response from USCIS
Students will receive a response from USCIS on their I-765 STEM OPT application. Students will either receive a Request for Evidence (RFE), approval notice, or denial notice. These different outcomes are outlined below:
Step 5: Maintain F-1 Status After STEM OPT Approval
Students will already have anSEVP Portal Accountto check on the employment information listed in their SEVIS record. Any changes to your personal information (address, phone number) must be updated in the SEVP Portal within 10 days of the change.
Students on STEM OPT cannot enter employer information themselves and must submit aSTEM OPT Employment Updaterequest in the ISSS Portal. The STEM OPT Employment Update request requires acompleted I-983 form with your new employerand aI-983 form, page 5 (bottom box) signed by your previous employer.
It is your responsibility to maintain F-1 status on STEM OPT!
Follow these regulations:
Update your address and any employer information within 10 days of the changeDo not delete any employers – this is for record keepingTo update your employer information, submit aSTEM OPT Employment Updaterequest

Keep track of your unemployment daysStudents are granted an additional 60 unemployment days on STEM OPT.This will be added to the number of unemployment days you did not use during regular OPT. For example, if you did not use any unemployment days during regular OPT, then you will have 90 (leftover from regular OPT) + 60 (added during STEM OPT) = 150 total unemployment days available.

More Information
Working for a staffing company or contractor during the STEM OPT Extension
Some graduates pursuing OPT will work for either staffing companies or contractors and wonder if they can continue to do so during STEM OPT.  The concern is that the student must have a “bonafide employer-employee relationship” with the company that hires, supervises, and pays them.
While this can be difficult to quantify, we suggest that if your supervisor from the company that technically hires you is involved enough in your work to complete the Form I-983 Training Plan with you thoroughly and completely, this can constitute a bonafide employer-employee relationship.  If the company you work for is too removed from your day-to-day work to complete the training plan, we do not suggest trying to work for this employer during STEM OPT.
When reporting your staffing/contractor employer during STEM OPT, please include the company name and address of BOTH the hiring company, and the company where you physically go to work, on the Form I-983. The hiring company address is entered page 2 of the Form I-983, and the location where you go to work each day is entered on page 3.
Please see the language from USCIS ontheir STEM OPT website, under “STEM OPT Employer Requirements and Responsibilities,” then “The Employer’s Training Obligation,” in the fourth paragraph.
Update (August 2018):  USCIS issued a statement and updated its website to clarify this.  The statement says: “DHS is clarifying that STEM OPT participants may engage in a training experience that takes place at a site other than the employer’s principal place of business as long as all of the training obligations are met, including that the employer has and maintains a bona fide employer-employee relationship with the student. DHS will review on a case-by-case basis whether the student will be a bona fide employee of the employer signing the Training Plan, and verify that the employer that signs the Training Plan is the same entity that employs the student and provides the practical training experience.”
So, in brief summary, STEM OPT does allow working in a separate location from your employer, BUT your employer (the entity paying your paychecks) has to be supervising you, such that they can complete the Form I-983 Training Plan with you thoroughly and accurately.  This DOES allow for contractual work (where your employer places you with a different company they have a contract with, but the actual employer still oversees your work remotely), but does NOT allow for staffing agency work (where the employer paying you has no involvement at all in your actual work).
STEM OPT Validation Reports
Students are required to submit the self-evaluation (page 5) from theI-983 training planat the following times:
By the end of the first year of STEM OPT extension (I-983 page 5, top box)
By the end of the second year of STEM OPT extension (I-983 page 5, bottom box)
Upon leaving a job during STEM OPT extension (I-983 page 5, bottom box)
This requirement is taken very seriously by USCIS, so please schedule reminders on your calendar and be sure to complete this obligation!  The government agency SEVP will also send you a reminder.
6-Month Check-in:
Our office is required to confirm your employer and home address every 6 months during STEM OPT.  You will receive an email prompt from SEVP to confirm with your DSO that the information in your SEVP Portal account is accurate. You should then submit aSTEM OPT Validation Reportrequest in the ISSS Portal.Please be sure to take action before the stated deadline in your email reminder.ISSS cannot complete your 12-month validation report until you submit your 12-month Form I-983 self-evaluation, signed by your supervisor. These are occasionally scrutinized by USCIS during applications such as for H-1B status, so please take this seriously and be sure to comply.
Please submit aSTEM OPT Validation Reportrequest in the ISSS Portal.
Unemployment:
STEM OPT gives you 60 days of unemployment time, plus any remaining unemployment time from your first OPT year’s 90 days of unemployment.
Address Updates:Please continue to use the SEVP Portal to keep your address, phone number and email address up to date.
Role of the SEVP Portal:During STEM OPT, you will still have access to your SEVP Portal.  You will use the SEVP Portal to update your address or contact information, and to verify that your employer information is correct.  Because of the requirement that ISSS verify your Form I-983 Training Plans, you will NOT be able to update your employer information on your own.
Best Practices for H-1B and Beyond:Be sure to review our website on OPT/STEM OPT Extension Best Practices, to help you keep good records and be prepared to present them in the case of an H-1b or other future immigration application:https://isss.umbc.edu/opt-and-stem-opt-best-practices-for-h-1b-and-beyond/
STEM OPT and H1B
Many students will have an employer file an H-1B petition on their behalf during the first year of OPT.  If you have a pending H-1B petition as your OPT gets close to expiring, it will be up to you to decide whether you want to apply for the STEM OPT Extension. Many students choose apply for STEM OPT in case their H-1B petitions are not selected for review, or in case they are denied. If your OPT end date passes and you are later denied or not selected for H-1B, you will NOT be able to submit a STEM OPT application after your OPT end date.
You can have both an H-1B petition and a STEM OPT application pending at the same time, and this will not impact your H-1B application. If your H-1B petition is approved, when it takes effect your STEM OPT Extension will automatically be cancelled by USCIS.
You can learn more about theH-1B process here.
You can also learn more about transitioning smoothly from STEM OPT to H-1B using theH-1B Cap Gap here.
