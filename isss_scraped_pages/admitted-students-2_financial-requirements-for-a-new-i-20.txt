What’s an I-20?
A Form I-20 is the immigration document required to apply for an F-1 student visa. The I-20 is issued by an individual school in the U.S., and includes a summary of all relevant information for the school and student, including the dates you are anticipated to be enrolled in the degree program at that school and how you will cover the costs of your education in the U.S.
While an I-20 includes three pages, the first page has the information that is relevant for new students.  A sample I-20 can be found here:Sample I-20
ISSS will work with all admitted Graduate and Undergraduate international students on all matters related to the I-20. Students outside the U.S. will receive a new I-20, and students already in the U.S. will work with ISSS to transfer their existing I-20 (SEVIS record) to UMBC.
Financial Requirements and Documents for I-20 Processing
To make a Form I-20 for you, ISSS must verify that you have been admitted, that your personal information is correct, and that you have adequate funding to cover the costs of your education in the U.S. F-1 regulations require admitted students to show proof of funding for the cost of living and studying in the US for one year.
We will need:
a copy of the bio (picture) page of your valid passport
financial documentation (see below)
aletter of financial support(if financially supported by another person)

*All students are responsible for paying fees, including students who have been awarded a Graduate Assistantship (GA/RA/TA).Tuition ratesare set by Student Business Services (SBS) and are subject to change. The Form I-20 is not a bill.
