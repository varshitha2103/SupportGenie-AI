Students who plan on working in a paid position after completing their program must receive work authorization. OPT (Optional Practical Training) is a type of work permission available for F-1 international students who finish their program requirements. OPT is approved by U.S. Citizen and Immigration Services (USCIS), with support from the university ISSS office. Students who are approved for OPT can work 1 year in unpaid/paid positions after completing their major program of study.

Application Process
Students must first receive a special OPT I-20 from the ISSS office before submitting their OPT application to USCIS.Applications submitted to USCIS without an OPT-specific I-20 will be denied. USCIS processing times can take up to three months or more, so students should plan ahead and apply early.Contact our officeabout any concerns or questions.
OPT applications must be submitted to USCIS no earlier than 90 days before your program end date and no later than 60 days after your program end date. OPT applications submitted to USCIS outside of this date range will be denied. Work with the ISSS office to prepare your application early.
Step 1: Request your OPT I-20
Students must first request a special OPT I-20 from the ISSS office.Applications submitted to USCIS without an OPT I-20 will be denied.
Students must submit a completeOPT requestin the ISSS Portal. First, students choose an OPT start date. The OPT start date can be any date within the 60 days after the I-20 program end date. Please refer to the table and/or graphic above to choose an OPT start date.
Second, students will need to upload a draft I-765. Students should download a draft I-765 by clicking “View Draft Snapshot” in their online USCIS account. Students who upload a draft I-765 with the incorrect format will need to re-upload it in the correct format.
ISSS will review each student’s OPT request and send an email if anything is missing. Once approved, students will receive an I-20 with the OPT recommendation listed on the second page.The I-20 should list “OPT Requested” on the second page, with requested start and end dates. Please contact us if anything needs to be corrected.

Submit a complete OPT request in theISSS Portal
Remember: you do not need a job offer before applying!
Step 2: Submit I-765 OPT Application to USCIS

Students will also be able to view their OPT I-20 in their request.Students must print out and sign their OPT I-20 with ink.Submitting an application without a signature will likely result in a denial. Finally, students must upload all required documentation and submit their I-765 application using theUSCIS online application system.The current fee for submitting an I-765 is $410. The fee is increasing to $470 and will go into effect on April 1, 2024.
USCIS Online Application Step-by-Step Guide
OPT Checklist
BEFORE YOU SUBMIT:Double check to see if “OPT Requested” with the requested start and end dates is on the second page of your I-20! If you submit your OPT application to USCIS without this OPT I-20, it will be automatically denied!
Step 3: Track Case Status
After submitting an application to USCIS, students will receive an I-797 Receipt Notice with a case number. Students can track the status of their application by entering their case number on theUSCIS Case Status website. USCIS processing times vary, and it can take up to three months to receive a response on an application. Checkcurrent USCIS processing timesfor an I-765 application.
If you recently moved or your mailing address has changed, update your address in your online USCIS account. It is important to list a current mailing address. Your EAD card will arrive at the mailing address listed in your USCIS online account. See further instructionshere.
USCIS recently expanded itsmyProgressprogram to include Forms I-765.myProgressaims to provide personalized processing time information, but it is a very, very new tool.
Step 4: Review Response from USCIS
Students will receive a response from USCIS on their I-765 OPT application. Students will either receive a Request for Evidence (RFE) notice, approval notice, or denial notice. These different outcomes are outlined below:
Step 5: Maintain F-1 Status After OPT Approval
