UMBC uses the J-1 Exchange Visitor visa to welcome visiting researchers, professors, students and collaborators from around the world.
The category was created “to increase mutual understanding between people of the United States and the people of other countries by means of educational and cultural exchanges,” according to the U.S. Department of State.
The J-1 visa category includes various types of visitors, and each category has its own rules and opportunities.

Within the overall J-1 visa status, there are several different types of visitor. Each category is used for different purposes and valid for varying lengths of time.  UMBC is approved to host the following categories of J-1 Visitors:
