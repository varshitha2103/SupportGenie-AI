Transfer your I-20 to UMBC
For students that are already in the US in F-1 status, if you plan to begin your studies at UMBC you can simply transfer your current I-20 to UMBC.  Your SEVIS ID will stay the same, but your I-20 will change to reflect the new school, new academic program, and new funding information.
After you are admitted to UMBC, your most recent school will need to release your SEVIS record (your I-20 record) to UMBC.The SEVIS school code for UMBC is: BAL214F00062000.
Requesting a UMBC I-20
Once admitted, you will receive an email from our office directing you to complete a New Student Request application. To do so please:
Log in to theISSS Portal Homepageusing yourmyUMBC username and password*
Click the “Search Forms” button
On the forms page, select“New F-1  Student Request”
Select your term and click “Create” Your term is listed in your UMBC admission letterFall = August Start DateSpring = January Start DateSummer = June or July Start Date
Fall = August Start Date
Spring = January Start Date
Summer = June or July Start Date
Review the “Instructions” section for required documents to submit
Upload required documents in the “Attached Documents” sectionFinancial Documentation,Financial Support Letter, Passport, Copies of all previous I-20s,I-94 Record, Copy of F-1 Visa Page
Financial Documentation,Financial Support Letter, Passport, Copies of all previous I-20s,I-94 Record, Copy of F-1 Visa Page
Complete “Dependent Request” and“Student: Immigration Information” in the “Questionnaires” section
Transfer students ONLY: If you are already in the U.S. on an F-1 Visa, complete the “Recommendations” section – this prompts your old school to transfer your I-20 to UMBC
Click the “Submit” button at the top of the page
Once you have submitted an application please allow 5-7 business days for review. At that time, you will receive an email from us to share your new I-20 with you.
For step by step screenshots of the process, click here:I-20 Request Tutorial
*To create yourmyUMBC account:
–VisitUMBC WebAdmin
– Click “Create My Account” (you will need your date of birth and UMBC Campus ID: EF81414)
Youmustcomplete this process before our office can issue a new I-20 form. You may receive an I-20 that indicates “transfer pending” and later another I-20 that says “continued attendance” after the semester begins. Please be sure to get your “continued attendance” I-20 within 30 days after the semester begins, though we should be contacting you about this.
Deadlines to Transfer
Your I-20 MUST be transferred to UMBC before your current I-20 end date, plus 60 days.  After these 60 days, your I-20 will automatically expire and cannot be transferred.
Your I-20 should be transferred to UMBC before the start of the semester in which you will begin your studies
Please note that you must begin your studies at UMBC in the next available semester, which can be up to 5 months after your previous I-20 end date.
Travel Abroad
If you will travel abroad before joining UMBC, we encourage you to get your new UMBC I-20 before travelling to avoid complications upon re-entry.   You can return to the US with a “transfer pending” I-20.
Renewing your visa
If you will need to renew your visa while abroad, you will need your UMBC “transfer pending” I-20, which will prove that you have been admitted to a new program and shows the date range in which you are expected to graduate.  Please contact our office for additional information about renewing your visa at isss@umbc.edu.
Note concerning the MVA
Transferring your I-20 sometimes causes issues with renewing yourdriver’s licenseat the MVA.  If you need to renew your driver’s license with a “transfer pending” I-20, we recommend you submit aSAVE Verification Requestin advance of your visit to the MVA.  Please note in the Comments section that you are currently transferring to a new school, and please wait to receive an approval on your verification request before your visit to the MVA.
International Student Orientation
All F-1 students new to UMBC are expected to attend the International Rules and Policy Meeting (IRPM) in addition to Undergraduate or Graduate Orientation.  More information is availablehere.
