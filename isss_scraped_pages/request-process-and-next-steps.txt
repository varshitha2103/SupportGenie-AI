Exchange Visitors (EVs) from certain countries, includingChina and Iran, routinely face additional scrutiny during the visa application process. Departments inviting EVs from those countries should initiate the process with ISSSat least 12 monthsbefore the proposed start date.

UMBC Scholar Portal
Click above to access the UMBC Scholar Portal.If you have a myUMBC account, click “UMBC Account Login” to log in with your UMBC credentials. If you use an email address and password to access your account, enter those instead.
The process of requesting J-1 Exchange Visitor status begins with the host department. Once the UMBC department has submitted a sponsorship request through the UMBC Scholar Portal, ISSS will review the request and, if approved, notify both the department and the prospective exchange visitor to complete the J-1 Request application.  Once submitted, we will review all required documents and issue the visitor a document called a DS-2019, which is used to obtain a J-1 visa stamp at the US embassy.
Purpose of the Exchange Visitor ProgramThe purpose of the J Exchange Visitor Program is to implement the Mutual Educational and Cultural Exchange Act (Fulbright-Hayes Act) of 1961,“to increase mutual understanding between the people of the United States and the people of other countries by means of educational and cultural exchanges.”
Visiting Scholars at UMBCAcademic departments are encouraged to take advantage of UMBC’s designation as a U.S. Department of State approved Exchange Visitor Program. Scholars typically come to UMBC to collaborate on research or teach courses, but may come for purposes of observing, training, or lecturing. Departments should designate a faculty host to assist the scholar once he or she arrives to campus.
The host department/college who plans to invite a J-1 Scholar to UMBC should be the faculty member who provides this requested information in the portal.
DS-2019 Information
The immigration document required to apply for a J-1 Exchange Visitor (EV) visa is a Form DS-2019.  The DS-2019 is issued by a school or other organization in the US, and includes a summary of all relevant information about the visitor, their sponsoring organization, and their program, as well as how the program is funded. When all the sections in the respective tabs have been filled and all documents have been uploaded, the DS-2019 can be created. It contains a SEVIS ID that will be needed to schedule a visa appointment. The DS-2019 will be digitally signed and electronically sent to the Exchange Visitor as it is needed for their appointment.
Instructions for host departments
ISSS staff will review the sponsorship request to determine if the individual is eligible for J-1 Exchange Visitor status.
If more information is needed, ISSS will contact the host department and/or the prospective visitor.
ISSS will contact both the host department and prospective Exchange Visitor to let them know if the sponsorship request was approved or denied. If approved, ISSS will give access to both the department and the Exchange Visitor to fill their respective tabs.
Both the host department and exchange visitor have sections to complete in the J-1 Request application.
Complete ALL the sections in the required questionnaire in the Department’s tab and upload ALL the required documents.
When submitting institutional letters of financial support, please use the following guidelines:Documents must have been issued within the last 3 months.The EV must be named as the recipient of the financial support.The account balance with currency or statement must specify that they have at least $2,000 USD of support per month.
