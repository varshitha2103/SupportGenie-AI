Information for H-1Bs
The H-1B is an employer-specific working visa for individuals holding “specialty occupation” positions at UMBC.  The H-1B petition scrutinizes the salary, working conditions, special skills, and educational background needed for the job. The employer will also need to attest to compliance with U.S. export control regulations and whether the research pursued by the H-1B worker requires access to technology considered proprietary or confidential.  To learn more about the Export Control provisions, see theInformation page for Visiting Students and Scholarsmaintained by UMBC’s Vice President for Research.
International individuals that have other possible immigration statuses with which they can work for UMBC will be advised to use these alternativesfirst.  However, if the hiring department or office wishes to pursue H-1b status to benefit the employee, and not out of necessity, this is considered an “elective” H-1B and will be processed by an attorney managed through our office. The hiring department or office will be responsible for the legal fees.

Submit their form (“Working Fund Check Request“, located at the bottom of their page) and add the documents in the links below to your request/s:I-129 form fee: $460 Filing fee.Fraud Detection and Prevention Fee: $500.

We highly recommend you do not travel outside the US while a petition is pending. However, we understand that in some circumstances, you may need to travel while your UMBC petition is pending. Depending on your case, please read the information below to understand the implications of traveling with a pending petition.
If our office filed achange of statuspetition for you:Please note that you must be in the U.S. when the H-1B petition is filed with USCIS.You must not travel outside of the U.S. while the petition is pending. Leaving the country while USCIS is reviewing your petition will cause USCIS to consider your petition for a change of status to be abandoned. Your underlying H-1B petition may still be approved, but you would have to depart the U.S. and apply for an H-1B visa abroad to re-enter the U.S. in H-1B status before you could start your H-1B employment.Once USCIS approves your change of status petition, you may travel internationally. Your H-1B status will take effect on the date that was requested.While travel, as outlined above, is permissible, you may encounter difficulties when re-entering the U.S. or when applying for a visa for your current status. Therefore, we recommend that you do not travel internationally from the moment your department starts the H-1B process with our office until your H-1B status takes effect.

If you arechanging employers:Please note that you must be in the U.S. when the H-1B petition is filed with USCIS.You may travel while the H-1B petition is pending. However, travel during this period is not recommended as you will need a valid H-1B Approval Notice and visa to re-enter the US.

Should your previous employer have withdrawn its H-1B petition – which is likely – you cannot use your previous H-1B approval.Therefore, it is strongly recommended that you do not travel internationally during this period as you may not be able to return until your UMBC H-1B petition has been approved.
